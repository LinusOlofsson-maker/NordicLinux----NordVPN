# NordicLinux - A linuxGUI for NordVPN https://nordvpn.com/
A simple yet effective way to streamline the use of NordVPN on Linux distros.  This simple gui is aimed to help new users get a feel for how to set up a NordVPN on a linux aswell as to streamline testing for more experienced users.  
It's nothing facny, a simple commaandline interface that allows for fast easy testing if you need to run several runs. 
It also allows for easy of access when your new. I've purposly not included everysetting but more than enough to get you going and more than enough to do streamlining work. 
I've also included the .sh file in .txt format. Again just to keep it easy for anyone thats new and stil in an easy way want to take part of the code. Yes I know, you could read it here or in any terminal, text-editor or whatever. But try to remeber the first time you touched linux.
