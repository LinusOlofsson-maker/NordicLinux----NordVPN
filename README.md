# NordicLinux - A linuxGUI for ![NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/)
A simple yet effective way to streamline the use of NordVPN on Linux distros. This simple GUI is aimed to help new users get a feel for how to set up NordVPN on Linux as well as to streamline testing for more experienced users.

It's nothing fancy, just a simple command-line interface that allows for fast, easy testing if you need to run several runs. It also allows for ease of access when you're new. I've purposely not included every setting but more than enough to get you going and more than enough to streamline your work.

I've also included the .sh file in .txt format. Again, just to keep it easy for anyone that's new and still wants to easily take part in the code. Yes, I know, you could read it here or in any terminal, text editor, or whatever. But try to remember the first time you touched Linux.

## To install:
````
git clone https://github.com/LinusOlofsson-maker/NordicLinux.git 
cd /NordicLinux \
chmod +x runnord.sh \
./runnord.sh 

````
or

wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinusOlofsson-maker/NordicLinux/main/runnord.sh"

Or any other way you please.

# A brief view 
I've included two pictures so that you can get a feel for what it's about. Note that the pictures are taken during generation 1 of the build; hence they might not be accurate to when you use this. But there shouldn't be any major changes, more so in functionalities and guidance.
